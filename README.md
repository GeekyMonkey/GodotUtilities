## Godot Launcher
    Command line app finds correct exe and runs with options to use the OpenGL 3 renderer.              

## Godot New Version Updater
    A powershell script you put in your godot folder in ProgamFiles.  
    
    Drop in new Godot executables, and run the script to rename them to their unversioned name, this way, your start menu and taskbar links to the executables do not need to change when a new version of Godot is installed.
